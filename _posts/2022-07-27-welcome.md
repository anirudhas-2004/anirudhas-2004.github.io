Welcome to my new website. I believe in keeping things simple and focused on what matters most: clear communication and useful information.

This site follows the principle that good design is often minimal (borderline invisible). Rather than flashy graphics or complex layouts, I prioritize:

- **Readability** - Clear, legible text that's easy to scan
- **Speed** - Fast loading times with minimal bloat
- **Accessibility** - Works well for everyone, on any device
- **Timelessness** - A design that won't look dated next year

Here's some sample code to test syntax highlighting:

```py
def hello_world():
    """A simple function to demonstrate syntax highlighting."""
    message = "Hello, World!"
    print(message)
    return message

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

I'll be sharing my work here regularly. Thank you for visiting.

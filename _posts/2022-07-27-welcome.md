Welcome to my new website.

Testing headings and lists...

## Good design prioritizes: 

- **Readability** - Clear & legible text
- **Speed** - Fast loading times
- **Accessibility** - Works well for everyone, on any device
- **Timelessness** - A design that won't look dated next year

Some sample code to test syntax highlighting:

```py
def hello_world():
    """A simple function to demonstrate syntax highlighting."""
    message = "Hello, World!"
    print(message)
    return message

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

I'll be sharing my work here regularly. Thank you for visiting.
